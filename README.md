### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Engineer with a drive to learn and expand my knowledge within the tech industry. Some things about myself, I have a passion for video games and basketball. I've played and watched both basketball and video games since I was young. I started out gaming with my family on our playstation. My favorite game would probably be Halo. This sparked the competitve nature in myself.
